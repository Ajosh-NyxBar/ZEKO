# Security Fix: Firebase Service Account Credentials

## What Happened
GitHub Push Protection detected that Firebase service account credentials were committed to the repository. These credentials contain sensitive information that should never be exposed publicly.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Removed sensitive file**: The file `zeko-70d2a-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-8aa211ce34.json` was completely removed from git history
2. **Updated .gitignore**: Added patterns to prevent Firebase credentials from being committed:
   - `*-firebase-adminsdk-*.json`
   - `google-services.json`
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist`

## What You Need to Do
1. **Get new Firebase credentials**: Since the old credentials were exposed, you should:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
   - Generate a new private key
   - Download the new service account file

2. **Place the file locally**: 
   - Put the new service account file in your project root
   - Name it exactly: `zeko-70d2a-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-8aa211ce34.json`
   - The file will be automatically ignored by git

3. **Update Firebase configuration**: If needed, update your Firebase configuration to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values.

## Template
A template file `firebase-service-account.json.template` has been created to show the expected structure.

## Security Best Practices
- Never commit credential files to git
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate API keys and service account credentials
- Use different credentials for development and production
